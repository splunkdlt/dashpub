# Dashboard Publisher

**EXPERIMENTAL** tool that creates a Next.js project for a given list of Splunk dashboards, optionally making the dashboards accessible to anyone using [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Search results are proxied through serverless functions, which handle authentication and efficient CDN caching.

## Prerequisites

-   [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) if you want to publish on Vercel

## Get started

1. Install `dashpub` CLI globally

```sh-session
$ npm i -g @splunk/dashpub
```

2. Initialize a new project

```sh-session
$ dashpub init
```

Follow the instructions to create your dashboard project.
